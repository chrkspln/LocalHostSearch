# Application (App) to find file on Local Host:

functionality:
1. App has to find file by "name".
2. Search has to be started from disk "C:\" on Windows
3. To make this search faster App creates new Searching Thread for each sub-directory in root directory, but not more than 8 Execution Threads.
4. Thread who will find needed file has to print Full Path to the file and
has to notify all the rest threads to stop searching.
- Logic "to search file" has to be placed into static library.
- Application just uses this library to find files in a fast way.

configuration:
Static Library compilation has to be done separately from Application.
Compiler: GCC or G++.
- Use Makefile for compilation/linking instructions.

Things to Google: (Concurrency, Makefile, GCC, Static Library)
